## From Source

# Usage

## Arguments

- `init` initialise a **SandCastle** project.
- `<task-name>` run the specified task.

## _castle.yaml_

This is a configuration file that contains all of the tasks and things that you want **SandCastle** to do.

Create a _castle.yaml_ file, using `castle init` or any other method of your choice.

The contents are as follows.

```yaml
config: # the configuration options
  log_shell_cmds: true # should it give a title for shell steps in a task?

  # log_level is for the internal logging of SandCastle
  log_level: debug # choose one of "info", "debug", "warn", "error" or "none" - these are

tasks: # the tasks, use the name of the task as a CLI argument
  run: # the name of the task
    - echo "Hello, World!" # the steps of the task
    - echo "Second Step!"
  deploy: # another task
    - echo "Deployed!" # you can use shell commands, or any other terminal command
```

Now, if we wanted to run the `deploy` task, we would run `castle deploy`. Just like that!

- bash
