## Installation
Download the latest release from our [GitHub Release](https://github.com/neuron-ai/sandcastle/releases/latest), and add it to your PATH environment variable. You may have to rename the file to **castle**, if you are on *MacOS*, as the file is called **castle-macos**

```yaml
build:
  - build_script arg1 arg2
  - second_build_script arg1

  - run_section arg1
  - run_more_sections arg1
```
